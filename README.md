# Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe)  

- Noughts and Crosses, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic game played between two players.
- It's a great way to engage in friendly competition and to improve strategic thinking.

The game rules are simple:
- Players alternate turns placing their mark (nought or cross) on a 3x3 grid.
- The goal is to get three of your own marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The first player to achieve this wins the game. 
- If the entire grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

It's all about outsmarting your opponent and predicting their moves. Enjoy!
